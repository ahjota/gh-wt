Fast and Ligtweight CoW-backed git worktree sessions . Linux uses OverlayFS,
macOS uses APFS clonefile(2).

```
disk used (GiB) — k same-tree worktrees of the Linux kernel (1.77 GiB, 93k files)

At k = 10 worktrees gh-wt uses **~8×** less disk; at k = 20, **~13×**.

## Installation

```bash
gh extension install HikaruEgashira/gh-wt
gh skill install HikaruEgashira/gh-wt gh-wt
```

> **Fork note:** This fork adds bare-repository support. Install it instead:
> ```bash
> gh extension install ahjota/gh-wt
> ```

## Usage

```bash
$ gh wt --help
Usage:
  gh wt list                            ... List worktrees
  gh wt add [--new|-b] <branch> [path]  ... Add a worktree
  gh wt remove [target]                 ... Remove a worktree
  gh wt gc                              ... Delete unreferenced cache entries
  gh wt [--at <wt>] *your_command*      ... Run a command in/with a worktree
```

`gh wt add` refuses to silently create a branch that doesn't already
exist locally or as `origin/<name>`. Pass `--new` (or `-b`) to opt into
new-branch creation from `HEAD`, or export `GH_WT_ASSUME_NEW=1` for
scripted use. On a TTY you'll get an interactive `[y/N]` prompt instead.

The fzf picker is skipped when there's only one candidate (`--select-1`),
when you pin the target with `--at <branch|path>`, or when you set
`GH_WT_NONINTERACTIVE=1` (which refuses to prompt and exits 2 with a
candidate list). This makes `gh wt` safe to call from CI, `nohup`, and
agent-driven shells (e.g. Claude Code) where `/dev/tty` is unavailable.

### Examples

```bash
# Create a worktree for a branch
gh wt add feature-branch

# Remove a worktree (interactive)
gh wt remove

# Open a worktree in VS Code
gh wt code

# Run a command inside a selected worktree
gh wt -- claude
```

### Bare repositories

`gh wt` supports both normal (non-bare) clones and bare repositories.
With a bare repo, worktrees are created as sibling directories and
share the same CoW disk benefits:

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/owner/repo.git ~/src/owner/repo
cd ~/src/owner/repo
gh wt add main           # first add: cold (builds APFS/OverlayFS reference)
gh wt add feature-x      # warm add: clonefile from main's reference
gh wt add feature-y      # warm add: same reference, ~constant disk
```

Resulting layout:

```
~/src/owner/
  repo/        # bare git dir (objects, refs, config)
  main/        # worktree (CoW-backed)
  feature-x/   # worktree (CoW-backed, shares blocks with main)
  feature-y/   # worktree (CoW-backed, shares blocks with main)
```

The bare repo directory itself is filtered out of the fzf picker and
`--at` resolution, so it can never be accidentally selected as a target
for `remove`, `exec`, or other operations.
